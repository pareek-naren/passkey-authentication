# Passkey Authentication
Passkey Authentication is a method of verifying a person's identity based on their unique physical or behavioral characteristics. This can include fingerprints, facial recognition, iris scans, voice recognition, and other types of biometric data. Passkey Authentication is often used as an alternative to traditional methods of authentication, such as passwords and security tokens, because it can be more secure and convenient. It can also help to prevent identity theft and other forms of fraud.
